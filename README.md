# Simple-Face-Mask-Detection---Real-Time-Face-Recognition

We will work with OpenCV to create this simple model. We will use the llaptop camera to detect the faces in real time, no other device is neccessary. In this simple model all we plan to do is detect if nose and mouth are covered correctly at the same time.
